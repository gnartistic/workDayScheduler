## Motivation

- My motivation for creating this web application was to help others make their daily work schedule much more structured in order to optimize their own productivity. I, too, struggle with organization and productivity. Creating this project in itself was a struggle for me, but now I will try to implement this scheduler for my own needs in the future.
